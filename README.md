# Compound Interest
This is a simple .Net Core application that can show how to calculate Compound Interest
In order to calculate Compound Interest we need to use the formulae 


   V = P(1+r/n)(nt)


V = the future value of the investment

P = the principal investment amount

r = the annual interest rate

n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year

t = the number of years the money is invested for


I have done bonus work as follow:
* Allowed you to select how often interest is compounded eg daily monthly and yearly
* Allowed to calculate compound interest over longer period than 1 year
