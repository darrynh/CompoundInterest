# CompoundInterest
This is a simple .Net Core application that can show how to calculate Compound Interest
In order to calculate Compound Interest we need to use the formulae 


   V = P(1+r/n)(nt)


V = the future value of the investment
P = the principal investment amount
r = the annual interest rate
n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
t = the number of years the money is invested for
